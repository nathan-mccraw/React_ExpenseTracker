Cloning the app directly from this repository will not let you freely push changes to the app.

5.  Navigate to the root directory of the app.  i.e. If you navigated to C:\Users\{YOUR ACCOUNT NAME}\Documents when you ran 'git clone', then there will now be a directory at       C:\Users\{YOUR ACCOUNT NAME}\Documents\React_ExpenseTracker.  All application files will now be in this folder.

6.  If you only wish to run the application, navigate to C:\Users\{YOUR ACCOUNT NAME}\React_ExpenseTracker to find index.html. Open this html file with google Chrome to view the     application without viewing the code.


## Summary
This application is an expense tracker that allows the user to input data points of an expendure to include: date, place, item, amount, and payment type.  This data is displayed in a HTML table and the user may delete entries from the table.  This project was made using React App, Bootstrap CSS, and Nodejs.  The react app was initialized using create-react-app and functional components with hooks were implemented in the app.  Building this application taught the premise and basis for passing props and states from one component to another.
